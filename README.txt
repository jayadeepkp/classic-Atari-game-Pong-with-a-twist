Design and implement the classic Atari game Pong with a twist; 
it will be a multiplayer game with client-server architecture. Created both the client and server
logic using what you have learned in the socket programming lessons, allowing players to compete against
each other in a game of Pong over a network connection

Imporatnt Information:
=====================
This project includes additional support files such as security.py
(for authentication & encryption), and the assets/ folder
(fonts, images, sounds, helperCode). These must remain in the same directory
structure for the program to run correctly.

The project uses a shared Fernet key (fernet.key) loaded by security.py. 
This file must stay with the project so that the server and all clients can encrypt/decrypt messages correctly.

General Info
============

This project implements a complete multiplayer Pong game using a
client–server architecture.

The server:
    • Accepts two players (left & right) and any number of spectators  
    • Runs the authoritative game loop (ball, paddles, scoring)  
    • Supports “Play Again” rematches (both players press R)  
    • Tracks wins in a persistent leaderboard (leaderboard.json)  
    • Serves the leaderboard webpage on port 80  
    • Provides user registration, login, password hashing, and  
      encrypted gameplay communication using Fernet  

The client:
    • Connects to the server using TCP  
    • Provides a Tkinter join screen (falls back to CLI if Tk is missing)  
    • Renders the Pong game using Pygame  
    • Sends encrypted paddle movement and rematch signals  
    • Supports full spectator mode (read-only stream)  

Prerequisites
=============
- Python 3.10+ installed with:
    - tkinter (for the GUI join screen; if missing, the client will fall back to CLI mode)
    - Pygame
    - The cryptography package

Install Instructions
====================

Python Version:
This project requires:

    Python 3.10 or newer

Recommended versions: Python 3.10 – Python 3.12

Older versions of Python may fail to install the "cryptography" package.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

       python3 -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate        (macOS/Linux)
       venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1       (Windows PowerShell)

2. Install required libraries:

       pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Running the Server
==================

Run the server from the project root:

    python3 pongServer.py

The server will:
    • Bind to 0.0.0.0:6000 for game clients  
    • Start an HTTP leaderboard on port 80 (may require admin rights)  
    • Wait for 2 players to connect  
    • Ask each player to register or log in

Make sure leaderboard.json, users.json, and fernet.key will be auto-created if missing.

Running the Client
==================

Start the client on another machine (or multiple machines):

    python3 pongClient.py

First two connections become:
    • Player LEFT
    • Player RIGHT

Any additional connections become spectators.

Players must:
    • Register or login once connected  
    • Use Up/Down arrows to move  
    • Press R after a win/lose to start the next round


Controls
========

Players:
    Up Arrow    – Move paddle up
    Down Arrow  – Move paddle down
    R           – After game over, press to signal ready for rematch

Spectators:
    No controls (view only)


Note
==========

- HTTP leaderboard page requires port 80. On some systems
  this may require admin/root privileges. If unavailable,
  the Pong game still works normally.
- Tkinter UI may not appear on minimal environments;
  the client automatically switches to CLI mode.
